# GDScript Syntax Benchmarks

Speed comparisons of various syntax alternatives within the GDScript language (Godot game engine).  All code is within [benchmarks.gd](benchmarks.gd), including funcs referenced in results table.

__SEE THE END OF THIS README FOR THE RESULTS TABLE__


## To Run Tests Yourself

* Open the project in Godot
* Click the lone node in the Scene/Node panel
* Click the unchecked box in the Inspector for the exported variable 'Click To Run'
* Wait several seconds for the tests to run (Godot editor may appear frozen during this time)

The script is a 'tool' and clicking this exported variable will trigger a setget function which actually runs the tests.  The results will be printed in the standard output and written to your disk as README.md (clobbering the existing README.md)

## Contributors

Please only add [benchmarks.gd](benchmarks.gd) to your commits.  This entire readme file is automaticaly generated by the script, so please do not commit changes to the readme itself.  Thanks!
